A cross-platform ping program for `TCP` ports inspired by the Linux's ping utility. This program will send `TCP` probes to an `IP address` or a `hostname` specified by you and prints the results. It supports both `IPv4` and `IPv6`.

**TCPING** uses different `TCP sequence numbering` for _successful_ and _unsuccessful_ probes, so that when you look at the results and spot a failed probe, inferring the total packet drops to that point would be easy.

Here are some of the features of **TCPING**:

- An alternative to `ping` in environments that `ICMP` is blocked.
- Monitor your network connection.
- Determine packet loss.
- Analyze the network's latency.
- Calculate `minimum`, `average` and `maximum` latency of network probes.
- Print connection statistics by pressing the `Enter` key, without stopping the program.
- Retry hostname resolution after a predetermined number of probe failures by using the `-r` flag . Suitable to test your `DNS` load balancing or Global Server Load Balancer `(GSLB)`.
- Enforce using `IPv4` or `IPv6`.
- Display the longest encountered `downtime` and `uptime` duration and time.
- Monitor and audit your peers network (SLA).
- Calculate the total uptime or downtime of your network when conducting a maintenance.

## Download

- ### [Windows](https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping/releases/latest/download/tcping_Windows.zip)

- ### [Linux](https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping/releases/latest/download/tcping_Linux.tar.gz) - Also available through `brew` and [.deb package](#linux---debian-and-ubuntu)

- ### [macOS](https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping/releases/latest/download/tcping_MacOS.tar.gz) - Also available through `brew`

- ### [macOS M1 - ARM](https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping/releases/latest/download/tcping_MacOS_ARM.tar.gz) - Also available through `brew`

When the download is complete, head to the [usage](#usage) section.

**Alternatively**, you can:

- Use the `Docker` images:

  ```bash
  docker pull pouriyajamshidi/tcping:latest
  ```

  > Image is also available on GitHub container registry:

  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/pouriyajamshidi/tcping:latest
  ```

- Install using `go install`:

  ```bash
  go install github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping@latest
  ```

- Install using `brew`:

  ```bash
  brew install pouriyajamshidi/tap/tcping
  ```

- Or compile the code yourself by running the `make` command in the `tcping` directory:

  ```bash
  make build
  ```

  This will give you a compressed file with executables for all the supported operating systems inside the `executables` folder.

---

## Usage

Follow the instructions below for your operating system:

- [Linux - Debian and Ubuntu](#linux---debian-and-ubuntu)
- [Linux, BSD and macOS](#linux-bsd-and-mac-os)
- [Windows](#windows)
- [Docker images](#docker)

Also check the [available flags here](#flags).

### Linux - Debian and Ubuntu

On **Debian** and its flavors such as **Ubuntu**, download the `.deb` package:

```bash
wget https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/tcping/releases/latest/download/tcping_amd64.deb -O /tmp/tcping.deb
```

And install it:

```bash
sudo apt install -y /tmp/tcping.deb
```

If you are using different Linux distros, proceed to [this section](#linux-bsd-and-mac-os).

### Linux, BSD and mac OS

Extract the file:

```bash
tar -xvf tcping_Linux.tar.gz
#
# Or on Mac OS
#
tar -xvf tcping_MacOS.tar.gz
#
# on Mac OS ARM
#
tar -xvf tcping_MacOS_ARM.tar.gz
#
# on BSD
#
tar -xvf tcping_FreeBSD.tar.gz
```

Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x tcping
```

Copy the executable to your system `PATH` like `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
sudo cp tcping /usr/local/bin/
```

Run it like:

```bash
tcping www.example.com 443
# Or
tcping 10.10.10.1 22
```

### Windows

We recommend [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) for the best experience and proper colorization.

Copy `tcping.exe` to your system [PATH](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) like `C:\Windows\System32` and run it like:

```powershell
tcping www.example.com 443
# Or provide the -r flag to
# enable name resolution retries after a certain number of failures:
tcping www.example.com 443 -r 10
```

### Docker

The Docker image can be used like:

```bash
# Using Docker Hub
docker run -it pouriyajamshidi/tcping:latest example.com 443

# Using GitHub container registry:
docker run -it ghcr.io/pouriyajamshidi/tcping:latest example.com 443
```
